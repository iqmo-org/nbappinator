# Introduction

nbappinator's goal is to make interactive Jupyter apps easier to develop and maintain, and reduce the learning curve involved with building & deploying Voila applications.

nbappinator provides an opinionated model for adding apps consisting of interaction widgets, such as buttons and dropdowns, along with display widgets including charts and grid / dataframe rendering.

A secondary goal is to make it easy to swap UI extensions, support different deployment environments, and insulate the developer from implementation decisions relating to web technologies.

By creating a TabbedUiModel, you can easily add new display widgets to each page/tab, and set interactions as function calls for each action.

# Foundation

nbappinator builds on a few great projects that provide useful building blocks in Jupyter, which themselves build on other great web technologies. Yet, nbappinator is intended to be implementation agnostic - a core goal is to allow any of these components to be swapped out.

- [ipyvuetify](https://ipyvuetify.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Provides the underlying UI widgets, bringing modern VUE components to Jupyter.
- [ipyaggrid](https://github.com/widgetti/ipyaggrid): Wraps the excellent [AG Grid](https://ag-grid.com/) javascript grid library. AG Grid provides some great enterprise features too.
- [ipytree](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets-contrib/ipytree): A tree widget for Jupyter

[Plotly](https://plotly.com/) is given first class support, although any matplotlib charting library works too, such as Seaborn.

This all builds on [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), of course.

# Getting Started

```py
import nbappinator as nbapp

PAGES = ["First Tab", "Second Tab"]

def my_action(component, action, args, app: nbapp.UiModel, caller: str):
    with app.messages:
        print("This message will be written to the Messages footer")

        app.get_page(PAGES[0]).add_textstatic("ts1", "This is some text")

def choose_action(component, action, args, app: nbapp.UiModel, caller: str):
    with app.messages:
        chosen_value = app.get_values(caller)

        print(f"You chose {chosen_value}")

        app.get_page(PAGES[1]).add_textstatic(f"You chose {chosen_value}")

# Create a Tabbed UI comprised of three sections:
# "Config" Header
# Tabbed Pages: "First Tab" and "Second Tab"
# "Messages" Footer
myapp = nbapp.TabbedUiModel(pages=PAGES, log_footer = "Messages", headers=["Config"])

myapp.get_page("Config").add_textstatic("This is some static text in the Config section of the page. You could add global settings, buttons and other widgets here.")


# Add a button to First Tab
myapp.get_page(PAGES[0]).add_button(name="b1", label="Some button", action=my_action)
myapp.get_page(PAGES[0]).add_textstatic("Click the button")

# Add a dropdown selection to Second Tab
myapp.get_page(PAGES[1]).add_select(name="s1", label="Choose A Number", options=list(range(10)), action=choose_action)

# Render the app:
myapp.display()
```
